Submitted by: **Mehmet Fazil Kayadelen**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

Link to project: (insert your link here, should start with https://glitch.com...)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
- [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked.
- [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked.
- [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
- [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.
- [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
- [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
- [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
- [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
- [x] Playback speeds up on each turn
- [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
- [x] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
- [x] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
- [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
- [x] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!
- [x] Tri-colored, blinking timer when time is less than 20 seconds.
- [x] User's click is blocked during clue-play.
- [x] Mobile-view friendly.

## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   Firstly, I didn't spend much time creating the HTML and CSS because I had enough knowledge to do that. So, I think creating the algorithm is the most challenging part. I got stuck on the optional features such as giving the user three strikes and making the blinking timer. However, after I've written the pseudo-code on my actual notebook, I could see the order that my code was supposed to be. Then I typed it on my computer. More specifically, creating the blinking timer and the click-block during clue play consumed a decent amount of time. There was more than a way to have them work. I have created new variables and functions. Then I run for loops and DOM(Document Object Model) in there. I looked up some of the use of syntaxes in JavaScript from MDN(Mozilla Developer Network).

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   I am wondering if I could make this website/web app work on an iPhone. Because I know how to make a responsive website a bit, and I made it work on mobile devices. It works ok on android (play-tone cuts too quick) but not at all on iPhone. Buttons don't pop-up back. So I'd like to make it work for all platforms, so all of the clients can access the website.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   I would convert some of the DOM HTML collections to NodeLists. Because it becomes an array, so your code gets shorter while keeping the same efficiency. I also would like to work on audio clips to add them on the playing buttons. Finally, I would definitely make an input panel, so the user will be able to choose how many buttons to be there, how long the clue-play is. So, it will determine the hardness of the game.
